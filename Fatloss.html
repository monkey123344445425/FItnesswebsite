		<p><i><h3>These are some tips:</h3></i></p>
		<p>Start by engaging in shorter duration and medium intensity workouts, gradually increasing both intensity and duration over time. Choose an activity you enjoy, like walking, running, swimming, or cycling. Set realistic goals and track your progress diligently. Consider incorporating HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workouts into your routine, as they involve short bursts of intense activity followed by brief rest periods and are excellent for calorie burning. Additionally, integrate strength training, such as weightlifting, into your regimen. Building muscle mass through strength training can enhance calorie burning and facilitate fat loss effectively.</p> </header>

		<li> Eat lesser than you do decrease carb intake and increase protein intake </li>
		<li>This will make you less hungrier and also good for the body</li>
		<li>Caloric Deficit: Consuming fewer calories than your body needs is essential for fat loss. Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and create a calorie deficit by consuming slightly fewer calories than your TDEE.</li>
<li>Macronutrient Balance: Ensure a balanced intake of macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Focus on high-quality sources of each</li>
<li>Protein: Helps preserve muscle mass and promotes satiety. Include lean protein sources like chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, beans, and lentils.</li>
<li>Carbohydrates: Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables over refined sugars and processed foods.</li>
<li>Fat: Opt for healthy fats from sources like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil while limiting saturated and trans fats.</li>

<li>Meal Timing: Spread your calorie intake across multiple meals throughout the day to maintain steady energy levels and control hunger. Some people find success with intermittent fasting, but it's essential to find an eating schedule that works for your lifestyle and preferences.</li>
<li>Hydration: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day, adjusting for factors like activity level and climate.</li>
<li>Fiber-Rich Foods: Include plenty of fiber in your diet from sources like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Fiber helps you feel full and satisfied, reducing the likelihood of overeating.</li>
<li>Limit Processed Foods and Sugars: Minimize your intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages. These often provide empty calories and can lead to weight gain.</li>
<li>Mindful Eating: Pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly, savoring each bite, and stop eating when you feel satisfied, not stuffed.</li>
<li>Healthy Snacking: Choose nutritious snacks like nuts, Greek yogurt, fruits, or veggies with hummus to keep hunger at bay between meals without sabotaging your fat loss goals.</li></p>
